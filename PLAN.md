## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: UI Design Integration (Days 1-2)

#### 1.1 Asset Integration
- [ ] Copy all image assets from `DYSLEXIQUEST_FRONTEND/src/assets/` to `frontend/src/assets/`
- [ ] Update asset imports and paths in components
- [ ] Add missing adventure theme images:
  - `forest_friend_background.png`
  - `galaxy_quest_background.png` 
  - `magical_castle_background.png`
  - `secret_island_background.png`
  - Character images for each theme

#### 1.2 Color Scheme and Design System Migration
- [ ] Extract CSS design patterns from `WelcomePage.css` and `GamePage.css`
- [ ] Convert CSS classes to Tailwind utility classes where applicable
- [ ] Create new custom CSS variables for the mockup's color scheme
- [ ] Update `tailwind.config.js` with new color palette:
  ```javascript
  colors: {
    welcome: {
      blue: '#B7D5E5',
      white: '#FFFFFF',
      black: '#000000',
    }
  }
  ```
- [ ] Merge design systems (keep both retro terminal theme and modern clean theme)

#### 1.3 Welcome Page Redesign
- [ ] Create new `WelcomeScreen.tsx` component based on `WelcomePage.jsx`
- [ ] Convert adventure selection cards to TypeScript interfaces:
  ```typescript
  interface Adventure {
    id: 'forest' | 'space' | 'magical' | 'mystery';
    name: string;
    image: string;
    background: string;
    description: string;
  }
  ```
- [ ] Implement animated sun/moon floating effects using CSS animations
- [ ] Add proper TypeScript props and state management
- [ ] Integrate with existing `useGameState` hook
- [ ] Maintain accessibility features (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

### Phase 2: Game Window Redesign (Days 2-3)

#### 2.1 Background Theme System
- [ ] Extend `GameWindow.tsx` to support dynamic backgrounds based on selected adventure
- [ ] Create `BackgroundTheme.tsx` component for managing theme-specific backgrounds
- [ ] Add CSS classes for adventure-specific styling:
  ```css
  .game-forest { background-image: url('./assets/forest_friend_background.png'); }
  .game-space { background-image: url('./assets/galaxy_quest_background.png'); }
  .game-magical { background-image: url('./assets/magical_castle_background.png'); }
  .game-mystery { background-image: url('./assets/secret_island_background.png'); }
  ```
- [ ] Ensure background images are responsive and accessible
- [ ] Add option to disable backgrounds for accessibility

#### 2.2 Choice Button Redesign

## Key Considerations

### Backward Compatibility
- All existing API integrations must continue to work
- Existing user settings and preferences should be preserved
- Game state management must remain functional
- Vocabulary and educational features must be maintained

### Accessibility Priority
- Never compromise on accessibility features
- Maintain or improve screen reader support
- Ensure all new UI elements are keyboard navigable
- Preserve dyslexia-friendly features and fonts

### Performance Requirements
- Background images should not significantly impact load times
- Animations must respect reduced motion preferences
- Mobile performance must remain optimal
- Progressive enhancement principles should be followed

### Type Safety
- All new components must be fully typed in TypeScript
- No `any` types should be introduced
- Existing type safety standards must be maintained
- Props and state should have proper interfaces

## Implementation Notes

### Asset Management
- Original mockup assets should be optimized for web (WebP format where possible)
- Multiple resolutions should be provided for different screen densities
- Fallback images should be available for older browsers

### Theme System
- The new modern theme should integrate seamlessly with existing retro and accessible themes
- Theme switching should be instantaneous and preserve game state
- All themes must meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast requirements

### Animation Philosophy
- Animations should enhance UX without being distracting
- All animations must have reduced motion alternatives
- Loading animations should provide meaningful feedback
- Entrance animations should not delay interactive elements

### Error Handling Strategy
- Asset loading failures should fail gracefully
- Network issues should be handled with appropriate user feedback
- Component errors should be caught by error boundaries
- Recovery options should be provided where possible

## Success Criteria

1. **Visual Fidelity**: New frontend matches mockup design while maintaining professional quality
2. **Functionality**: All existing features continue to work without regression
3. **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance maintained or improved
4. **Performance**: No significant performance degradation
5. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript compliance with no type errors
6. **Cross-platform**: Works correctly on all supported browsers and devices
7. **Backend Integration**: All API calls and game state management function correctly
8. **User Experience**: Smooth transitions and intuitive interface improvements

## Risk Mitigation

### High Risk Items
- Breaking existing API integrations → Extensive testing and gradual rollout
- Accessibility regressions → Automated accessibility testing and manual verification
- Performance issues with background images → Image optimization and lazy loading
- Type safety complications → Incremental TypeScript adoption and thorough testing

### Mitigation Strategies
- Feature flagging for gradual rollout of new UI elements
- Comprehensive test suite covering all existing functionality
- Accessibility audit at each phase
- Performance monitoring during development
- Regular stakeholder feedback and approval checkpoints

## Timeline Summary

- **Total Estimated Time**: 8 days
- **Critical Path**: UI Design Integration → TypeScript Conversion → Backend Integration Testing
- **Buffer Time**: 2 additional days for unexpected issues and final polish
- **Milestone Reviews**: After Phase 2, Phase 5, and Phase 7

This plan ensures a systematic, risk-aware approach to migrating the mockup design while preserving all existing functionality and maintaining the high standards of accessibility and user experience that the current frontend provides.
