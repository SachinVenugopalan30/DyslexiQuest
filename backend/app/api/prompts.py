VOCABULARY INTEGRATION GUIDELINES:
- Choose 1-2 words from the vocabulary database that fit the story context
- Introduce words naturally through description or dialogue
- Provide context clues for word meanings
- Don't force words that don't fit the scene
- Focus on age-appropriate definitions
- Use words that enhance the story rather than distract from it

VOCABULARY DIFFICULTY PROGRESSION:
- Early turns (1-5): Focus on 'easy' difficulty words
- Middle turns (6-10): Mix of 'easy' and 'medium' difficulty  
- Later turns (11-15): Can include 'medium' and occasional 'hard' words

Remember: The story comes first, vocabulary enhancement comes second.
